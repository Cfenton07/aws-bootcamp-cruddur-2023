# Week 2 — Distributed Tracing
## Added yaml code to connect my container to Opentelemetry collector so that my backend-falsk can cend traces to the Collector and then forward them to Honeycomb.
### See code changes to my Docker-Compose file below

### From the initial config set up for my Open Telemetry set up I was receiving the following error:
What does this mean: Exception while exporting Span.

Traceback (most recent call last):

  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/urllib3/connection.py", line 198, in _new_conn

    sock.connect(sa)

ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused

## I inquired Gemini about this error and here is what I found out:

### This means that your application successfully generated a trace span (a piece of telemetry data), but it failed to send it to its intended destination.

Let's break down the error message and its implications:

Exception while exporting Span.: This is the top-level message. It clearly states that the problem occurred during the "export" phase of a "Span."

Span: In OpenTelemetry, a span represents a single operation or unit of work within a trace. For example, an API call, a database query, or a function execution can be a span.

Exporting: This is the process of sending the collected telemetry data (spans, metrics, logs) from your application to an observability backend (like an OpenTelemetry Collector, Jaeger, Datadog, etc.).

Traceback (most recent call last):: This is a standard Python traceback, showing the sequence of function calls that led to the error.

File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/urllib3/connection.py", line 198, in _new_conn
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/urllib3/util/connection.py", line 85, in create_connection
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/urllib3/util/connection.py", line 73, in create_connection
sock.connect(sa):
These lines show that the error occurred deep within the urllib3 library, which is a Python HTTP client library often used by other libraries (like requests and, by extension, OpenTelemetry's OTLP HTTP exporter) to make network connections. Specifically, it happened when urllib3 tried to establish a raw socket connection (sock.connect(sa)) to a remote address.

ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused:
This is the core problem. It's an operating system error that means:

Your application (the client) attempted to connect to a specific network address (IP address and port).

The machine at that address actively refused the connection. It wasn't just unreachable; it explicitly sent back a "connection refused" signal.

What does this imply in the context of OpenTelemetry?

This error typically means one of the following:

The OpenTelemetry Collector (or whatever service you're trying to send traces to) is not running. Your application is trying to "talk" to a server that isn't there or isn't listening for connections.

The OpenTelemetry Collector is running, but it's not listening on the expected port or IP address. For example, your application might be configured to send to localhost:4318, but the Collector is configured to listen on a different port, or only on a specific network interface other than localhost.

A firewall is blocking the connection. While less common for localhost connections (if both your application and the Collector are on the same machine), a strict firewall could prevent even internal connections. If the Collector is on a different machine, a network firewall is a very common cause.

In summary, your application did its job of creating the telemetry data, but it failed at the last step: sending that data out because the intended recipient was not available or not accepting connections at the specified address and port.

To resolve this, you need to ensure that the service that is supposed to receive your OpenTelemetry traces (most commonly an OpenTelemetry Collector) is running and correctly configured to listen on the address and port that your application's OpenTelemetry exporter is trying to connect to.

## I also had to download the OpenTelemetry tar.gz file since I kepts getting an connection refused issue with an initial setup for sending traces to Honeycomb.
### (OpenTelemetry Collector, the .tar.gz file is used to distribute the pre-built executable binary along with any other necessary supporting files (though often it's just the single executable).

Instead of downloading many individual files, I download one compressed .tar.gz file. Once downloaded, I use a command like tar -xvf to extract the actual executable (e.g., otelcol-contrib) from within it. I then run this extracted executable.

So, its purpose is to provide a convenient and compressed way to package and distribute the OpenTelemetry Collector software for Linux systems.)

![Open Telemetry ".tar.gz" file](https://github.com/Cfenton07/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/_docs/assets/Opentelemetry_Collector_2025-07-08%20122133.png)

## Here's an explanation of what you've done in the docker-compose.yml file:

In the provided docker-compose.yml file, you've integrated the OpenTelemetry Collector into your multi-service Docker setup. This is a significant step towards centralizing your application's observability.

Specifically, you've made the following key changes:

Introduced an otel-collector Service:

You've added a new service block named otel-collector. This defines a new container that will run the OpenTelemetry Collector.

image: otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest: This specifies that the Collector container will be built from the official otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib Docker image, ensuring you have a feature-rich version of the Collector.

command: ["--config=/etc/otelcol/config.yaml"]: This tells the Collector executable inside the container to use a specific configuration file.

volumes: - ./otel-collector/config.yaml:/etc/otelcol/config.yaml: This is crucial for configuration. It mounts your local config.yaml file (which you should place in a ./otel-collector/ directory at your project root) into the /etc/otelcol/config.yaml path inside the Collector container. This allows you to manage the Collector's behavior from your local project files.

ports: - "4318:4318" and - "4317:4317": These lines expose the standard OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) ports from the Collector container to your host machine. This makes it possible for your backend-flask application (and potentially other services or external tools) to send telemetry data to the Collector. Port 4318 is for OTLP over HTTP, and 4317 is for OTLP over gRPC.

environment: HONEYCOMB_API_KEY: "${HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}": This passes your HONEYCOMB_API_KEY environment variable (which you set on your host machine before running Docker Compose) into the otel-collector container. The Collector's config.yaml then uses this variable to authenticate when forwarding data to Honeycomb.

restart: unless-stopped: This ensures that if the Collector container stops for any reason (e.g., due to an error), Docker will automatically try to restart it, improving the reliability of your observability pipeline.

Modified the backend-flask Service:

OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: "http://otel-collector:4318": You've updated the backend-flask service's environment variables. Previously, it might have been configured to send traces directly to Honeycomb. Now, it's explicitly told to send its telemetry data to the otel-collector service (which is reachable by its service name otel-collector within the Docker Compose network) on port 4318.

depends_on: - otel-collector: This instructs Docker Compose to start the otel-collector service before attempting to start the backend-flask service. This helps prevent "connection refused" errors from your Flask app if the Collector isn't ready to receive data yet.

In essence, you've shifted your observability strategy from direct application-to-Honeycomb communication to a more robust architecture where the OpenTelemetry Collector acts as an intermediary. Your Flask application now sends its traces to the local Collector, and the Collector is responsible for processing and securely forwarding that data to Honeycomb. This provides benefits like buffering, batching, and potential future routing to multiple observability backends without changing your application code.

![Open Telemetry added director ](https://github.com/Cfenton07/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/_docs/assets/otel-collector%202025-07-08%20123142.png)

## The file above .tar.gz was too large to commit back to my repo so I had to delete it and create a config.yaml file and added it to the otelcol directory set in my main worspace ... that yaml file had the instructions to set the ports for the otlp receiver for the Collector to listen to (port 4318) and and then set the port for the exporter to automatically forward from the Collector to Honeycomb on port 443. I also defined my receiver, processor and exporter in this file...see below

```yaml
# config.yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318 # Collector listens for OTLP over HTTP on port 4318
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317 # Collector listens for OTLP over gRPC on port 4317

processors:
  batch: # Batches data for efficient export
    send_batch_size: 1000
    timeout: 10s

exporters:
  # This configures the Collector to forward data to Honeycomb
  otlp/honeycomb:
    endpoint: "https://api.honeycomb.io:443"
    headers:
      "x-honeycomb-team": "${env:HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}" # Reads API key from HONEYCOMB_API_KEY env var
    # If you are using a specific dataset (for Honeycomb Classic users), uncomment and set:
    # "x-honeycomb-dataset": "YOUR_DATASET_NAME"

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/honeycomb]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/honeycomb]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp/honeycomb]
```
## I added the xray for python by building a container that runs the xray daemon. I also added the xray sdk for flask in my app.py file; added segments to the notifications_activities file to send trace data to xray when the endpoint is called. Lastly, I created a CloudWatch log group to capture activity from my home_activities file. In the process of building this out I ran into an issue with my xray. 

### I kept seeing the following errors in my backend-flask logs for the container:

## The core issue is that the AWS X-Ray SDK was losing track of the main request segment that its Flask middleware is supposed to manage. This causes the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'put_http_meta' because the middleware tries to update a segment that no longer exists in its context.

My previous suggestions were aimed at troubleshooting this context loss. Now, we'll implement a more robust solution by:

Ensuring the Flask route itself is explicitly captured by X-Ray: This helps solidify the main request segment's context.

Using in_subsegment in your NotificationsActivities.run(): This is the correct way to create a nested trace within an existing parent segment (which the Flask middleware provides).

Here are the exact updates you need to make:

1. Update your app.py file
Replace the entire content of your current app.py file with the following code. The key change is adding @xray_recorder.capture('notifications_api_call') above your data_notifications route.
Okay, I understand. You want the complete, updated code for both files directly in this response, along with a very clear, step-by-step guide. No problem!

The core issue is still that the AWS X-Ray SDK is losing track of the main request segment that its Flask middleware is supposed to manage. This causes the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'put_http_meta' because the middleware tries to update a segment that no longer exists in its context.

Replace the entire content of your services/notifications_activities.py file with the following code. The key change is using xray_recorder.in_subsegment() instead of xray_recorder.in_segment(). I've also updated the print statements to reflect "subsegment" for clarity.

Save Both Files: Make sure you save both app.py and services/notifications_activities.py after making these changes.

Restart Your Flask Application: Stop your Flask application if it's running, and then start it again. This ensures the new code is loaded.

Test the Endpoint: Access the /api/activities/notifications endpoint in your browser or through a tool like Postman/curl.

Why these changes?

@xray_recorder.capture('notifications_api_call') in app.py: This decorator on the Flask route function explicitly tells the X-Ray SDK to create and manage a segment (or subsegment if a parent exists) for the entire execution of that route. This helps reinforce the X-Ray context from the very beginning of the request handling, making it more likely that the Flask middleware will find an active segment when it needs to add HTTP metadata at the end.

xray_recorder.in_subsegment() in notifications_activities.py: When the Flask middleware is active, it already creates a top-level segment for the incoming HTTP request. Any custom tracing you want to do within that request should be done as a subsegment of the main request. in_subsegment() is designed for this purpose, ensuring it correctly attaches to the existing segment context and doesn't inadvertently close the parent segment.

This combination should provide the necessary context for the X-Ray middleware to function correctly throughout the request lifecycle, resolving the NoneType error.

# Okay, let's break down the current flow and purpose of my application based on the app.py, notifications_activities.py, and docker-compose.yml files.

The application is a Python Flask backend that serves various API endpoints. It's designed to run within a Dockerized environment, leveraging multiple services for different functionalities like tracing, logging, and data storage.

Here's a summary of what's going on and the flow of processes:

1. Docker Compose Orchestration
The docker-compose.yml file defines and manages several interconnected services that form your application stack:

backend-flask: This is your core Python Flask application. It's built from the backend-flask directory and exposes port 4567.

xray-daemon: This container runs the AWS X-Ray daemon. Its primary job is to receive trace data from your backend-flask application (on UDP port 2000) and then securely forward that data to the AWS X-Ray service in the cloud. It's configured to use your AWS credentials and region.

otel-collector: This container runs the OpenTelemetry Collector. It's configured to receive OpenTelemetry traces (via OTLP HTTP on port 4318) and then export them, likely to a service like Honeycomb (based on your environment variables).

frontend-react-js: Your React-based web interface, which interacts with your Flask backend.

dynamodb-local: A local instance of Amazon DynamoDB for development and testing purposes.

db: A PostgreSQL database instance, used for persistent data storage.

All these services communicate with each other over a Docker network named crudder.

2. Flask Application Initialization (app.py)
When the backend-flask container starts, your app.py script executes, setting up the Flask application and its various integrations:

Environment Variables: The application reads crucial configuration values (like frontend/backend URLs, AWS credentials, X-Ray URL, OpenTelemetry endpoint) from environment variables, which are injected by Docker Compose.

CloudWatch Logging: A Python logging instance (LOGGER) is configured to send application logs (INFO, ERROR, etc.) to AWS CloudWatch Logs using the watchtower library. These logs go to a specified log group (cruddur) and a unique log stream, providing centralized logging. Logs are also printed to the console (standard output).

OpenTelemetry Setup:

A TracerProvider is set up to manage tracing.

Spans (traces) are processed by a BatchSpanProcessor which sends them via OTLP to your otel-collector service.

A ConsoleSpanExporter is also added, meaning some trace information will be printed directly to your Flask application's console output for debugging.

RequestsInstrumentor().instrument() is enabled. This is important: it automatically instruments any outgoing HTTP requests your Flask application makes (e.g., if your Flask app calls another external API), sending those traces to the OpenTelemetry Collector.

Crucially, FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app) is commented out. This means OpenTelemetry is not automatically instrumenting incoming HTTP requests to your Flask app. This responsibility is handled by AWS X-Ray.

AWS X-Ray Setup:

The xray_recorder is configured with a service name (backend-flask).

XRayMiddleware(app, xray_recorder) is initialized. This middleware is the primary entry point for X-Ray tracing for incoming HTTP requests to your Flask application. It automatically creates a top-level X-Ray segment for every incoming HTTP request.

CORS Configuration: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is set up to allow your frontend application (and potentially other origins) to make requests to your backend API.

@app.after_request Hook: A custom Flask hook runs after every request, logging basic request details (timestamp, IP, method, path, status code) to your configured LOGGER.

3. Request Flow for /api/activities/notifications (and other traced endpoints)
Let's trace what happens when an HTTP GET request hits your /api/activities/notifications endpoint:

Incoming Request: An HTTP GET request arrives at your backend-flask service for /api/activities/notifications.

X-Ray Middleware Interception: The XRayMiddleware intercepts this request. It creates a main X-Ray segment for this entire HTTP request and sets it as the current active segment for the request's context.

Route Function Execution: Flask dispatches the request to your data_notifications() function.

@xray_recorder.capture('notifications_api_call'): Because this decorator is applied to data_notifications(), an X-Ray subsegment named notifications_api_call is automatically created. This subsegment is nested under the main request segment created by the middleware. This helps group and name the trace for this specific API call.

Calling Service Logic: data_notifications() calls NotificationsActivities.run().

xray_recorder.in_subsegment('notifications_activities'): Inside NotificationsActivities.run(), you explicitly create another X-Ray subsegment named notifications_activities. This subsegment is nested under the notifications_api_call subsegment. This allows you to trace the specific business logic within this service method.

Logic Execution: The code inside NotificationsActivities.run() executes, generating mock data.

Subsegment Completion: As the with xray_recorder.in_subsegment(...) block in NotificationsActivities.run() exits, the notifications_activities subsegment is marked as complete.

Route Subsegment Completion: As the data_notifications() function finishes, the notifications_api_call subsegment (from the decorator) is marked as complete.

Middleware Finalization: The XRayMiddleware's _after_request hook runs. It accesses the main request segment (which has been active throughout the request) and adds HTTP response details (like the 200 OK status) to it. It then finalizes this main segment, which now contains all its nested subsegments.

Trace Submission to Daemon: The finalized X-Ray trace segment (containing the main request segment and its subsegments) is sent from the backend-flask container to the xray-daemon container on UDP port 2000.

Daemon Processing: The xray-daemon receives these segments, buffers them, and then forwards them to the AWS X-Ray service in the cloud.

Response to Client: The Flask application sends the HTTP response back to the client.

4. Other Tracing & Logging in the Logs
OpenTelemetry Traces: You'll see OpenTelemetry trace output in your Flask logs (e.g., for home-activities-mock-data). This indicates that while OpenTelemetry isn't instrumenting incoming Flask requests, it is being used for other internal spans or outgoing requests (via RequestsInstrumentor). These traces are sent to your otel-collector.

CloudWatch Logs: All LOGGER.error and LOGGER.info calls (including the after_request hook) are sent to CloudWatch Logs, providing a centralized place to monitor your application's operational logs.

In essence, your system is now configured for robust observability, sending traces to both AWS X-Ray (for request tracing) and OpenTelemetry Collector (for other specific spans and outgoing calls), and sending application logs to CloudWatch.
