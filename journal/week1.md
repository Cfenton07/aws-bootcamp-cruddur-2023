export BACKEND_URL="*"
python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
cd ..
```
- make sure to unlock the port on the port tab next to the terminal
- open the link for port 4567 in your web browser
-  make sure to update the url with the finishing path "https://4567-cfenton07-awsbootcampcr-qy3ay4ksobg.ws-us120.gitpod.io/**api/activities/home**"
-  you should now see json

```yaml
FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

# Inside Container

WORKDIR /backend-flask

# Copy from Outside Container --> To Inside Container
# This contains the libraries we want installed
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt

# Inside Container
# This will install the python libraries used for the app inside the container
RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Copy from Outside Container --> To Inside Container
# The (.) means everything in the current directory
# The first (.) means everything "outside" the /backend-flask container
# The second (.) means everything "inside" the /backend-flask container
COPY . . 

# Set environment variables or (Env Vars)
# This is set inside of the container and remains set when the container is running
ENV FLASK_ENV=development
